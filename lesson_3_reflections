When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

--I think this is a cool tool to make remote changes without using my own
  computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

--To have the control of whats pushed and pulled in my repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

--Forks are like make an own copy that yo can destroy or do with it what
  everything you want, make a clone is like "download" all the repository to
  you computer and branches are branches.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

--More control and less problems.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

--With services like Google Drive, using an USB or work in the project in a
  physical place.
  This makes it harder workflow, but can make easier the communication.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

--When I want to make experimental changes in the project.
  This is a good practice and also is benefits to do not make in master branch.
